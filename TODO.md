Todo List:
 - [x] Move all files from my domain onto the file area of this site
 - [x] Remove AP as part of setting PATH
 - [ ] Update 'Remove Access Patrol' to remove all Netgear related monitoring
 - [ ] Allow users to choose directories for NZBget (ie per Transmission)
 - [x] Check /home is not mounted on /dev/md0 before moving /opt to hdd
 - [ ] Add sabnzb (unless someone can nail the nzbgetweb issues)?
 - [ ] Add info for each install ie 'transmission available @ hostname:90191'
